# RedBot Cogs Repository of SaigoNoo
Hi! My identity is SaigoNoo. I'm student in IT in Belgium and learn about basic programation (Python, C, ...)
I learn about Database Management, Network Security and Administration, Electricity, eletroni and telecomunication. I love video-games too, but that's not the main subject.


## What kind of cogs you do 
Mainly I try to create for all domain, but mainly, I create things arround of **Plex** or for *Music* !

## Your level in Python for discord API
I think you will be afraid if I tell you I know nothing about discord API. However, by using this repository, I will be able to learn quickly by make test/fail as I did for other languages !

## OK, but where could I look for your stable cogs
For the moment, I havn't create a repository for stable cogs, because I'm starting to create cogs, but when my first cog will be ready to be released, I would create a new repository for !
